# Workday-Scheduler

This project is a workday planner that displays the current date and time at uplon loading. The time begins at 7:00 AM and ends at 3:00 PM. It has times listed to the left, a text area in the center and a save button for each task, to the left of the text area. The save button saves the taks into local storage and the tasks persist even after refresh. Depending on the time, if a taks row is past the current time, the task color will be greyed out. The current time slot is displayed in red, while future time slots are displayed in green.
